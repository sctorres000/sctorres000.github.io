      <h1>Hi! I’m Sophie Torres</h1>
      <h2>I am a designer, photographer, and illustrator. I am a current senior at Princeton University and am expect to graduate in June of 2021 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Art History and a certificates in Visual Arts.</h2>
      <p>Art has always been an incredibly important part of my life; I have been practicing illustration as well as analogue and digital photography since 2014, taking classes at prevalent institutions like the International Center of Photography. However, it wasn’t until my senior year of high school, in 2017, that I was introduced to design-thinking when I was tasked with creating my school’s yearbook. I loved being able to apply my more creative instincts to problem-solving and so I decided to pursue this interest in college – I became a member of Princeton’s Student Design Agency, a member of the UX/UI group ResInDe, and the Design Coordinator for Princeton’s Undergraduate Student Government Social Committee. I hope to continue working in this area in a more professional setting and am looking forward to using my skills in problem-solving and design as well as my interest in artistic trends to help craft modern solutions for users.</p>
